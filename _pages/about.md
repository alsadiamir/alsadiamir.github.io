I am a Research Assistant in User-Centred Systemsâ€™ Security/Privacy and part of the [NetSys Group](https://netsys.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at the Department of Computing of Imperial College London under the supervision of Professor [Hamed Haddadi](https://haddadi.github.io/), and a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Bologna (Italy) under the supervision of Professor [Marco Prandini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/marco.prandini) (expected defense date: June 2025). 

My research interests covers the intersection between <b>security</b> and <b>systems</b>. During my Ph.D., I used programmable data planes to detect Denial of Service attacks and implement in-network computing for data integrity. You can find my publications in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TAFPIhoAAAAJ&hl=en) or my [publications page](/publications/).
